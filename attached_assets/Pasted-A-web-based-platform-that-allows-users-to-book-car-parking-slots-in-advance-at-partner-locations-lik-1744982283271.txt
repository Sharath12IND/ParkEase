A web-based platform that allows users to book car parking slots in advance at partner locations
like malls, shopping centers, and event venues. This reduces last-minute parking stress, improves
traffic management, and enhances customer convenience for both drivers and facility managers.
Abstract & Overview
We are developing a smart car parking slot booking system that bridges users and commercial
spaces (malls, business parks, events) through an intuitive web application. The system ensures real-
time slot availability, advance booking, automated management, and secure transactions —
powered by a robust, scalable tech stack.
